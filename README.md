# Drag-and-drop Demo

A simple drag & drop landing page using Vue.js.

## Requirements

1. Create 2 draggable blocks: Text and Image.
2. The content of the Text block should be editable.
3. Image block can be edited by selecting one of the 3-4 predefined images.
4. The user should be able to rearrange, duplicate and delete blocks.
5. Landing page data like text content, links to images, block order, etc. should be exported to JSON format when the user clicks the “Save” button (console.log is enough).
6. Style the application using CSS or a CSS framework of your choice (e.g., Tailwind CSS).
